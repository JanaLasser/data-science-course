    "Basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)** : is indeferrent to our claims, assumes nothing interesting is going on between whatever variables we are testing, and attributes the extreme outcomes to pure chance. Represents the status quo in the relevant research field.\n",
    "* **Alternative/research hypothesis ($H_a$)**: statement that we are trying to prove by consucting the inferential statistics. Normally, we claim that a differencr **DOES** exist between the variables of interest.\n",
    "* **Test statistic**: to decide between two hypotheses, we shall choose the statistic upon hich we will base our decision.\n",
    "* **Prob. distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis**: setting aside our observed value of the test statistic, we instead focuses on what the value of the statistic might be if the null hypothesis were true \n",
    "* **Significance level $\\alpha$**: a probability threshold that determines when we _reject_ the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one you observe due to chance is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This probability of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is known as the **p-value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. If there is little evidence against the null hypothesis given the data, you accept the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is unlikely given the data, you might reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis: there is something interesting is going on. The exact form of the alternative hypothesis will depend on the specific test you are carrying out. \n",
